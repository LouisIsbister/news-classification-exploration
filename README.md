# news-classification-exploration
The goal of this project was to learn and apply key text representation techniques and evaluate their performance on a corpus of textdual data instances.

Explored techniques:
1. Training purely on Term Frequency 
2. Training on Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features
3. Simple CNN initialised with random embeddings
4. A CNN with the same structure as prior CNN, but initialised with GloVe embeddings
5. Full CNN trained on preprocessed textual data
